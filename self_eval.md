# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

*Whenever you want to test out several possibilities for potential values in variables*

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

* I didn't have to rely on other resources as I was familiar what was needed for the solutions to the challenges. I would probably just mock search for the solutions, and perhaps even more elegant solutions for practice on how to search for solutions. * 

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

*TBH having fun with the solutions and writing silly message. But also, challenging myself to go a bit further when I knew there was probably another solution, or additional code I could write to satisfy my learning such as the end of the comparisons section. Practice is what this course is all about, and I don't want to cheat myself by just completing assigments and then moving on. Victor did give me that advice though yesterday, that completing the minimum of what is asked, THEN doing extra is a good tactic.*
